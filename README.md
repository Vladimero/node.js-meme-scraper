# Node.js Meme Scraper

... running node index.js should ...

command line tool to scrape memes from "memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app"
...

Own notes:

1. directory created through command: mkdir memes
2. add new directory to .gitignore: just by typing "memes" into any line followed by a slash / directory "memes" went light grey as the directory "node_modules"
3. find a way to access from VSC JS Code the website
   - fetch method (left it cause way complicated )
   - library for accessing :
     - https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
4. find a way to filter/split the necessary information from the Html code through library "Cheerio" or "JSDOM" --> cheerio way is not working ...
5. convert the strings (Url) into arrays
6. use loops for getting necessary information into an array
